Hello there, let's take a stroll down memory lane and uncover the remarkable story of Dr. Sun Yat-sen - a man they called the "Father of the Nation" and one of the founders of the Republic of China. 

You see, we're standing right in the heart of Hong Kong, the very place where this incredible figure spent his formative years. Dr. Sun arrived on these shores and dove headfirst into both secondary and tertiary education.  

That's why we're here today - to walk in the footsteps of this legendary figure and uncover the rich history hidden within these streets. 

this place – the University of Hong Kong – is pretty special. It's the oldest institute of higher learning in the whole region, founded way back in 1911. And get this – it's got a really interesting connection to a famous historical figure. 

From 1887 to 1892, the legendary Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the "Father of the Nation," was a student right here. He was enrolled at the College of Medicine for Chinese, Hongkong. And then, in 1912, that college was incorporated into the University of Hong Kong as the Faculty of Medicine.   

But the story doesn't end there. In 1923, Dr. Sun came back to the university, this time as an honored guest. And he gave a speech in the Great Hall, now called the Loke Yew Hall. *pauses* And in that speech, he said that "Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong are my intellectual birthplace."  

looks around, it's just fascinating to think about all the history and all the brilliant minds that have passed through these halls. You may take a look around before we move to the next stop.
