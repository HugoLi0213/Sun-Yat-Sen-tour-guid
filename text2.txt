Welcome back, Lets trace his footsteps through this city. The Diocesan Home and Orphanage – an important part of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's journey here in Hong Kong.  

You know, after spending four years studying in Hawaii, Dr. Sun came to Hong Kong in late 1883 and initially attended the Diocesan Home and Orphanage, which was founded by the Anglican Church. *pauses* It was quite an institution back then – a home and orphanage that provided education and support to young people.  

It was likely a formative experience for him, shaping his worldview and setting him on the path that would lead him to become the revered "Father of the Nation."  

And then, after a stint at the Diocesan Home, he went on to attend The Government Central School here in Hong Kong, further expanding his horizons.   

**pause** Standing here. It's a reminder of the rich tapestry of history that makes up this city, and the important role it played in shaping the life and aspirations of such a pivotal figure.
