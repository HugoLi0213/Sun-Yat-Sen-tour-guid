Lets get to it again!

In 1883, a young Dr. Sun arrived in this vibrant city and began his path towards greatness. From his initial enrollment at the Diocesan Home and Orphanage, operated by the Anglican Church, to his residence at the Preaching House of the American Congregational Church (now the China Congregational Church) on 2 Bridges Street, we will uncover the tapestry of cultures and faiths that influenced the young Dr. Sun. 

It was here, in the Preaching House, that he was baptized, adopting the Christian name "Yat-sen" (or "Rixin" in Mandarin). Even as he transferred to The Government Central School, Dr. Sun continued to call this place home, laying the groundwork for his future revolutionary endeavors in the city. 

We look forward to guiding you once more on this captivating expedition, as we uncover the formative experiences that shaped the revolutionary who would go on to leave an indelible mark on history. Let us commence our journey and delve deeper into the early life of this remarkable figure.
